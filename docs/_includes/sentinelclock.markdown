## Understanding The Game Clock

The game's clock is a number of seconds since midnight of the first day. There is no day zero. Since new save files start at noon of the first day, the lowest natural clock value is 43,200.

Use the [convertGameClock](../functions/convertGameClock.html) JavaScript function to convert a between clock seconds and human-readable values.
