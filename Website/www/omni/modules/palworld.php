<div class="notice-block notice-info">Palworld originally had its own Omni license, but due to lack of demand and features, is now free for all users. If you purchased a Beacon Omni for Palworld license, read <a href="/blog/palworld_omni_end_of_life">this blog post</a> to learn more about what has been done for you.</div>
<p>Palworld has a small number of options that are not yet complex, so Beacon has just one Palworld editor: General Settings.</p>
